# Pedro Muñoz

✅ I help companies and organizations to solve their problems through data analysis. I like to do a careful and very organized work so that my solutions stand out

✅ I have a broad experience in the Big Data ecosystem (Spark, Impala, Flume...) and in the Machine Learning one (Tensorflow, OpenCV, Scikit-Learn...)

✅ I am the AWS DeepRacer Spanish League winner, where I developed an autonomous driven car model using Reinforcement Learning

✅ I am the creator of [moderator-guru](https://moderator-guru.com), an NLP tool that is capable of detecting and classifying toxic comments. I've developed all web and chat interfaces, along with the analytics stack on [hr-bots](https://hr-bots.com)

✅ I developed an open source project [datatau](https://datatau.net) which is a Data Science newsboard based on Hacker News
